so first, i took the provided message and wrote it into a notepad. i downloaded the file and placed it into a folder which I used as my directory. this file was called 'ciper.txt'

this was my code which was writted based on the assumption that the letters were shifted over by 3.

function caesar(in_filename, out_filename, shift)
    % Open the cipher file for reading
    inID = fopen(in_filename, "r");
    if inID == -1
        error("Could not open input file");
    end

    % Open the output file for writing
    outID = fopen(out_filename, "w");
    if outID == -1
        error("Could not open output file");
    end

    % Read and decode each character in the input file
    while ~feof(inID)
        inputChar = fread(inID, 1, '*char');  % Read one character at a time

        % Check if the character is alphabetic
        if isletter(inputChar)
            if isstrprop(inputChar, 'upper')
                % Handle uppercase letters with ASCII base 'A'
                base = 'A';
            else
                % Handle lowercase letters with ASCII base 'a'
                base = 'a';
            end
            
            % Apply Caesar shift (subtract shift) and wrap within alphabet
            decodedChar = mod(double(inputChar) - double(base) + shift, 26) + double(base);
            fwrite(outID, char(decodedChar));  % Write decoded character to output
        else
            % If not alphabetic, write character as-is
            fwrite(outID, inputChar);
        end
    end

    % Close the files after processing
    fclose(inID);
    fclose(outID);
end

using this, i inputed the following into the command window: "caesar('cipher.txt', 'decryption.txt', -3);"
this created a new file called decryption which opened up in my directory, opening that file, the decrypted message was found to be the following:

"‘I WISH IT NEED NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN MY TIME,’ SAID
FRODO.
‘SO DO I,’ SAID GANDALF, ‘AND SO DO ALL WHO LIVE TO
SEE SUCH TIMES. BUT THAT IS NOT FOR THEM TO DECIDE.
ALL WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHAT TO DO WITH THE TIME
THAT IS GIVEN, US."
